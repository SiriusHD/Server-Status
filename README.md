This is a basic web-facing server status page.

The commands used to retrieve information assume a Debian or Debian-based Linux system. Some values are hard-coded to my specific hardware and may need to be changed.

Inspired by and uses code from [installgentoo.net](http://installgentoo.net).
IP and Speedtest from [cyprieng's fork](https://github.com/cyprieng/status).
